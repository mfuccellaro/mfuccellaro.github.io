**Im am looking for an intern for a 5 month internship on *program synthesis*, the subject is available [here](https://theomat.github.io/files/stage.pdf).
Feel free to contact me if you are interested or just to know more!**

Since October 2021, I am a PhD student at [LaBRI][LABRI], Université de Bordeaux, under the supervision of [Nathanaël Fijalkow](https://games-automata-play.com/) and was also under the supervision of [Laurent Simon](https://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/) until April 2022.
I graduated from [ENSEIRB-MATMECA][ENSEIRB] in September 2021 with a major in AI.

You can send me an email at `x@gmail.com` where `x = theomatricon`.

**Feel free to send me a mail just to chat about some interesting work, not necessarily yours!**
